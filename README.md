# EA-Portfolio

My portfolio represents the scope of assignments and projects I have completed and contributed to during my studies in Northwestern University's Full Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp.

Individual projects have included a Trivia Game, a Hangman Game, a Giphy Call API app, a Train Scheduling app using Google's Firebase on the backend, and a group project to compile a Movie Night app.
